## Introduction
LLM Query Generator simplifies the process of generating structured queries using LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT models. The main objective is to automate query generation for diverse datasets and specific search tasks, improving efficiency in information retrieval and content generation. This tool can be used in various domains, including search engines, question-answering systems, and AI-driven automation.

## Features
- Generate structured queries for text datasets
- Support for various query types (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, Elasticsearch queries)
- Easily adaptable for multiple LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Configurable prompts to meet specific use cases
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI)
- Integration with existing systems

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/diyamth/LLM-Query-Generator.git
2. Install required libraries:  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Example
Here’s an example of generating a SQL query:
python generate_query.py --input "Get all users who signed up in 2024" --output-format SQL
